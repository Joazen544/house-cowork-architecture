## Status

Accepted

## Context

The original product name is 'House-Cowork'.

- It was too long to pronounce.
- Want a name more special.
- Want more connections with our culture or language.

## Decision

The new name is 'Justwoo'.

- Have a similar pronunciation in Chinese with '家事'.
- Feels woo after finishing the houseworks.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **House-Cowork**: The original name.
2. **KaSu**: Similar pronunciation in Taiwanese with '家事'. Not so clear what it means.
3. **KaRaiSu**: Similar pronunciation in Taiwanese with '家內事'. A better name than KaSu, more clear what it means in Taiwanese, but may be hader to pronounce.

## Consequences

- Need to update the product name in all places.
