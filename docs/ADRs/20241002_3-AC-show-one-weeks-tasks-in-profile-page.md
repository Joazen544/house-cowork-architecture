# 0003-AC-show-one-weeks-tasks-in-profile-page

## Status

Accepted

## Context

- Need to show tasks in user profiles
- Calendar view not ideal for detailed task display
- Seeking a more concise presentation

## Decision

Show one week's tasks in the profile page:

- Dates at the top
- Detailed tasks below

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Calendar view**: Too crowded and hard to read for multiple tasks per day

## Consequences

- Improved readability
- Limited to one week view
- Requires multiple clicks for viewing future months
- Less overall schedule visibility
